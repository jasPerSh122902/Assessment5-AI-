# *Post Mordom*

# _What went wrong_ 
In this project, I had to make an AI that can make decisions and can path Find. I began the project thinking that it was easier but I was wrong the first AI idea that I made in Lucid had 3 different AI the first was basic with the flee and seek but the second had a teleport that would only happen if the seek was happening then the third would also teleport in the flee. But getting the flee to work correctly in a short time was not going to happen and so I scraped all of them and just went with the basic AI and made it wander and seek with pathFinding. But I made my wander not go through the walls that are in the Maze scene.

# _What went well_
The Maze and the enemy work well together. This was one of the first times I made a true maze and so it looks good to me and the enemy wander and seek can correct a bug that the enemy gets stuck on the maze itself. But also the controls and feel of the game or assessment feel just right in my hands. Also the way the AI gets the decision using the cone of vision that is my favorite part.
